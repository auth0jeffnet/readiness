Work flow 
- environment: linux systemd service (continuous unless 
  stopped/permanently disabled)
- start up: load configuration (listen port, plugin folder, number of 
  simultaneous tests), start application loop
- application loop: load plugin and its configuration, identify “most 
  expired” plugins ignoring “too recent” plugins, perform at most N tests 
  simultaneously, store results, sleep, restart application loop
- results: via URL, load stored results and render report

Data flow: tests
- load configuration
- run test
- capture results data
- refactor results data to plugin structure

Data flow: report
- identify results of each individual test
- aggregate results from each test
- generate result data in JSON
- render JSON result data (HTTP, cli, /proc/auth0readiness, etc.)

Configurable items:
- systemd configuration: Unit section (Description, After), Service 
  section (WorkingDirectory, ExecStart, Restart, User, Group), Install 
  section (WantedBy)
- daemon configuration: number of simultaneous checks, report port, 
  plugin folder
- plugin configuration: name, frequency in seconds, help link
- report: render format (dynamic on generation: JSON, HTML, text)

Variable storage items:
- last execution time for each plugin
- results for each plugin

Estimate timeframes:
    2018.07.16 targeted completion
        - data structures defined
        - data interfaces defined
        - basic service flow (testing stub, reporting stub)
    2018.07.18 targeted completion
        - plugin framework
        - enhance service (plugin tests, reporting via JSON)
    2018.07.19 targeted completion
        - thread management
    2018.07.20 targeted completion
